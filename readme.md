# rcvComplex
Red does not support complex numbers (z = a + ib), such as 3+4i, 5-2i, -8+7i or i (iota).
This is a more or less complete Red implementation for Complex Numbers.

## to be documented
i (iota) must be expressed as 1.0i

1 + i must be expressed as 1.0 + 1.0i

magic values for complex numbers

i = square-root -1
i^2 = -1
